Cotton Disease Detection
A machine learning project to detect and classify cotton plant diseases using image data.

Introduction
This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural experts by identifying diseases in cotton plants through image-based detection. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze images of cotton leaves and predict the presence of specific diseases or classify them as healthy.
